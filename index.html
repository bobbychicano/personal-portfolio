      <u><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></u>
      <div class="introduction">
        <p>Howdy, I’m Robert and this website serves as my portfolio as a web developer. I designed this site from scratch so that I would have full control over the design and to showcase my abilities in HTML & CSS. I’ve kept it pretty simple to align to my personal belief that less is more. Below you will find five of my most recent projects that I am proud of. With that said, I know the journey never ends and I am constantly learning in efforts to continue improving.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Please open the links below on a desktop or laptop since they have been optimized for that environment, with the exception of the last project which has been optimized for a mobile environment. My resume is also available further down for a more detailed summary of my experience. </p>
        <br>
        <p>And finally, at the end of this page you can find my email address to contact me about web development opportunities. As always, I continue to hone my skills and dive deeper into the ocean that is web development.</p>
