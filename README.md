## Personal Portfolio

This repository houses my personal portfolio with a short introduction, links to my other projects, my resume, and my contact information. This portfolio is what will be shared during my career search.

My goal by building a portfolio website from scratch is to showcase my abilities in HTML & CSS and prove to employers that I have the abilities and the creativity to develop websites proficiently.

My portfolio is a responsive website optimized for mobile and desktop environments.

This is an open project that will be updated regularly to incorporate new styles and formatting.
